# Postlight-Directory-React

In order to keep everything simple I’ve setup a Github repo for this project and it can be reached here: https://github.com/robokoech/Postlight-Directory-React 
I created the employee directory using React so after downloading the project to your local system and navigating to the the project in your terminal, use the following two prompts to get everything up and running:


$ npm install

$ npm start


About:
In terms of design I wanted to go with a simple UI that highlighted the employees themselves along with an easy to use filter that could quickly narrow down employees based on user input. Thanks to React the filter is able to pull from the applications back-end(firebase) database very quickly and display employees based on their department, title or both. Additionally I added an area for creating an employee that takes in all the necessary user input (department, title, name, location, email), verifies that all the input has been entered and generates an employee card with just a few clicks. Please click around the app, test out the filter and add an employee or two!
 
Features to note  ⭐️ 
React front-end, Firebase realtime database back-end, employee card creation, easy filtering.
 
What would be more complete in your project in a production environment?

There would be a great deal to work on but for starters:

1. I’d add Mobile responsiveness.

2. Fix some of the CSS styling/spacing issues I ran into.

3. Refactor the code in general.

4. Add security features like locking down the database and having a secure way to add and delete employees and protect their information.
 
 
Thanks for your time, I hope you enjoy :)
